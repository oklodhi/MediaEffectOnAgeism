				<p>Ageism is prejudice towards someone based on their age. There are a variety of factors that tie into ageism such as ethnicity, race, social class, and even media platforms. Social media has been one of the biggest factors that has affected ageism in a both positive and negative manner. Social media serves as a means for people to communicate, state their opinions, and receive information and with the rise in different platforms, there has been a rise in ageism. A major reason that ageism still exists is due to the gap in communication and language and how language and modern-day speech can convey different meanings and assumptions that can lead to stereotyping and discrimination. People don’t realize the way they are communicating to others. Whether it’s spoken or written language, there tends to be a bias that feeds negative patterns which are commonly normalized.

					<p>Ageism became a great issue that focused on dealing with racism and discrimination issues. Later, this discrimination also added sexism to the list. Over time, one of the largest factors in the “aging of America” is the concern over population segregation. Domestic issues such as federal debt, social security, health care, housing, and political power still continue to add to the issues of ageism. </p>

					<p>There have been many advancements in technology and media platforms over the years. Today, 67% of seniors use the internet. This is a high number considering that two decades ago the number was at 55%. Social media platforms play a major role in the way we communicate today. In regard to aging, social media has been positive and negative in the life of older adults. Some positive aspects of social media are that it allows for older adults to keep in touch with family members and stay involved. They can share their experiences and have means to socialize with friends and family. However, social media also has negative effects on older adults. Becca Levy focused on analyzing Facebook Groups to determine whether ageism is existent throughout social networking sites. Research indicated that social media platforms are a gateway to negative age stereotyping. A lot of social media platforms can create barriers between the generations leading to miscommunication and stereotyping.</p>
