				<p>Ageism is prejudice towards someone based on their age. There are a variety of factors that tie into ageism such as ethnicity, race, social class, and even media platforms. Social media has been one of the biggest factors that has affected ageism in a both positive and negative manner. Social media serves as a means for people to communicate, state their opinions, and receive information and with the rise in different platforms, there has been a rise in ageism. A major reason that ageism still exists is due to the gap in communication and language and how language and modern-day speech can convey different meanings and assumptions that can lead to stereotyping and discrimination. People don’t realize the way they are communicating to others. Whether it’s spoken or written language, there tends to be a bias that feeds negative patterns which are commonly normalized.

					<p>Ageism became a great issue that focused on dealing with racism and discrimination issues. Later, this discrimination also added sexism to the list. Over time, one of the largest factors in the “aging of America” is the concern over population segregation. Domestic issues such as federal debt, social security, health care, housing, and political power still continue to add to the issues of ageism. </p>

					<p>There have been many advancements in technology and media platforms over the years. Today, 67% of seniors use the internet. This is a high number considering that two decades ago the number was at 55%. Social media platforms play a major role in the way we communicate today. In regards to aging, social media has been positive and negative in the life of older adults. Some positive aspects of social media are that it allows for older adults to keep in touch with family members and stay involved. They can share their experiences and have means to socialize with friends and family. However, social media also has negative effects on older adults. Becca Levy focused on analyzing Facebook Groups to determine whether ageism is existent throughout social networking sites. Research indicated that social media platforms are a gateway to negative age stereotyping. A lot of social media platforms can create barriers between the generations leading to miscommunication and stereotyping.</p>

					<p>The “Ok boomer” meme created a lot of conflict on social media. It shows us that there is a huge generational conflict in American culture. There is a divide in culture because of the different environments in which the younger generation is brought up as compared to the older generations which is a problem. The younger generation blames the older generation for not facing problems of society in a serious manner and ignoring them in a way. It also conveys the message that the older generations may have perpetuated some of the problems that millennials are blamed for. The meme is ageist because it’s a way to tell elders that their views are irrelevant and old fashioned.</p>

						<p>Stephen Cutler examines how ageism influences technology and vice versa. He considers aging to be a motivating factor while looking at technology because technology can become a need towards reducing the negative impacts ageism has. He also suggests that ageism plays a very important role in how new technology is developed and marketed which leaves the older population at a disadvantage.</p>

						<p>In her article Lytle discusses the impact of how ageism played a role in determining the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The stereotypes created for and against ageism has both a positive and negative impact towards how people perceived the candidates. She also discusses how older adults are generally perceived in the media in the United States; as depressed, grumpy, inactive, unhealthy, and as having poor memory. This shows us how social media tends to create a difference as impactful as the 2016 presidential election. It is important to note that in the coming years, as more and more people grow old, there will be more older candidates who run for president and are stereotyped against in the media. Furthermore, the articles focus on ageism's impact on Hillary and Trump (representation in political cartoons, media coverage of certain topics, and etc.) can be used to compare ageism between male versus female demographic. The different ways that both are represented in the media, creates a big gap within society.</p>

						<p>Many people from the younger generation have different views towards the old people, and everyone has started considering this hatred as an understandable quirk rather than offensive behavior. This has largely been the case in many government related issues and political issues. On the other hand, some elderly folks are treated too delicately, and those same elderly people resent this soft treatment.</p>

						<p>The core problem is that many senior citizens are often thought to be trapped in an outdated mindset. This, alone, creates a big generation gap, and makes it very hard for the younger generation to sympathize with the elderly people. The general view towards having different perspectives and different opinions changes very rapidly now in the 21st century.</p>
